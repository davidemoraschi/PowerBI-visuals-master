## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

There are many ways in which you can contribute.  
 
We plan to accept community code contributions including new chart types, bug fixes, and additional features for existing chart types.   We're still working out the contribution guidelines. Hold tight, we'll update you here when we've formalized the guidelines.   
 
In the meantime, you can contribute to Power BI Visuals in a few different ways:
* Submit bugs by opening an Issue.
* Contribute to discussions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/powerbi).
* Follow the [Power BI Developer](http://blogs.msdn.com/powerbidev) blog for updates.
